# Lawn-Care

<p> <div class=greetings> Greetings! </div>My name is Amiyah Smith, my partner's name is LeBreauna Barnes, and our team is constructing a website for my father's lawncare service.
My dad has been trimming yards for years now, and he does a marvelous job, as many people inform him, but it's hard to get his name out there with all
of the competition. He works extremely hard for our family by working and cutting grass by himself at the same time, so I thought of this
as a way to show my appreciation and help to find business opportunities.
I want to try my best to spread word of what my father is capable of, and what he's willing to do for people.</p>
