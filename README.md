# Lawn-Care

<p> <div class=greetings> Greetings! </div> My name is Amiyah Smith, my partner's name is LeBreauna Barnes, and our team is constructing a website for my father's lawncare service. My dad has been trimming yards for years now, and he does a marvelous job, as many people 
inform him, but it's hard to get his name out there with all of the competition. He works extremely hard for our family by juggling a job and cutting grass by himself, so I thought of this as a way to show my appreciation and help to find business opportunities.
I want to try my best to spread word of what my father is capable of, and what he's willing to do for people.

My partner and I are going to give the website our all, and here's what you can expect to see from us.

 <ul>
  <li>Pictures- Our website will have a multitude of visual properties and high-quality images. When you open the website, you will be    able to see proof of what my father is able to do. Most of the pictures will be 'before and after', but some will consist of different    types of services he provides. Visuals are a main factor when it comes to a website.</li>
  <li>Detailed Descriptions- In the case that you aren't very experienced in the yardcare business, terms will be broken down easily, and   in a way that anyone can understand. We take into account that our audience may be unknowing in this field, so my father and I will
  word complicated phrases into simple sentences in order to gain more customers, and higher satisfaction.</li>
  <li>Information about Us- We strive to build trusting relationships with our clients, but trust is hard to gain when you're a stranger.
  In the wibsite, there will be a page where you can access a bit of background about my father and his business, such as where it began,   or why he chose to do it. This will bridge a gap between
